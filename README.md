Google Discovery API binding in Prolog

A very imcomplete project!
All this does is display the root of the Google Discovery API 
as a human friendly page.

It's posted for two reasons:

1) It's a nice little demo of how to grab JSON data from a REST API

2) If someone does need the google discovery API this is a nice start on it.
